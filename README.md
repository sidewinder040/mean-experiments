# MEAN Project

Purpose learn MEAN by creating an project in stages, primarily using upstream project documentation (not Stack Overflow... well sometimes, if all else fails!).

### Barebones Express application 
Use the Pug view engine (as Jade has been deprecated).
Command: 

`$ npx express-generator --git --view=pug`

### MVC - Create 'Home Controller'
* Modify route '/home' to output message.

# MEAN Project

Purpose learn MEAN by creating an project in stages, primarily using upstream project documentation (not Stack Overflow... well sometimes, if all else fails!).

### Barebones Express application 
Use the Pug view engine (as Jade has been deprecated).
Command: 

`$ npx express-generator --git --view=pug`

### MVC - Create 'Home Controller'
**Git Branch - CreateHomeController**

* Created controller
* Created home route
* Modified app.js to use route 
* Render basic view - view name *route_view name.pug*, in the 'Views' root folder.

### MongoDB with Mongoose.js

Next Step...
